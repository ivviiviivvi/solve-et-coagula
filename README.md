# 4_S0VRC3

> A living specification that implements itself.

---

## The Problem

Creative knowledge management systems fragment across tools, lose context over time, and lack meaningful organization that reflects how creative work actually evolves. Folders and tags are not enough—they impose static structure on dynamic, recursive creative processes.

## The Approach

4_S0VRC3 implements RE:GE:OS (Recursive Generative Operating System)—a symbolic operating system where:

- **The vault structure IS the specification** — organizing principles encoded in directory layout
- **Naming conventions encode meaning** — consonant-only UIDs create semantic identifiers
- **22 organizational bodies** map creative functions to mythic archetypes
- **Experimental code lives in safe containment** — the Habitat System isolates experiments
- **The specification implements itself** — documentation and implementation are unified

The repository name tells the story: *radix-recursiva–solve–coagula–redī* — root recursion, dissolve and coagulate, return. Alchemical transformation through recursive self-reference.

## The Outcome

A self-documenting creative system with built-in knowledge transfer, emergency recovery procedures, and clear pathways from experimentation to production. The vault serves as master database for all creative work—writing, protocols, myths, and documentation.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .
habitat-demo
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full command reference and development setup.
