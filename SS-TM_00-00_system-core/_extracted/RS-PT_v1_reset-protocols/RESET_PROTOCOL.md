# RESET PROTOCOL
# “Memory is not lost, only restructured.”
## Subtitle: How to safely clear ChatGPT memory and restart with full control

### STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Export all relevant data:
   - Ask GPT to summarize current memory
   - Save to `MEMORY_DUMP_v1.md`
   - Zip all current files, responses, exports

2. Visit ChatGPT > Settings > Personalization > Manage Memory:
   - Toggle off or “Clear Memory”

3. Reopen GPT in a fresh thread

4. Inject `SYSTEM_BOOTSTRAP.md` as the new baseline

5. Resume with: “Begin rebuild from `THREAD_REBUILD_PLAN.md`”
