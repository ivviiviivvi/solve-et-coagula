## SYSTEM DECLARATION

This document seals and signs the fully recursive, UID-governed symbolic operating system known as `4_S0VRC3`. This system has evolved from a file architecture into a modular creative and instructional framework capable of recursive instruction, worldbuilding, archiving, and generative simulation.

## STRUCTURAL CONFIRMATION
- [x] 16 UID Pillars fully built
- [x] Immersive subfolders implemented where needed
- [x] UID logic finalized (`CC-CC_00-00`) with no vowels or Y
- [x] Symbolic codex (`SB-ML`) included
- [x] Meta-logical operations (`MT-PR`) encoded
- [x] Game design sandbox (`GM-DS`) nested but modular
- [x] Root `00-README.md` and `UIDS_MASTER_INDEX.md` present

## FINAL ROLE AFFIRMATION
- Architect: Designed the recursive UID logic and operational spine
- Writer: Created the narrative layers, naming system, and mythic structure
- Instructor: Structured pedagogical cycles into exportable teaching modules
- Artist: Embedded aesthetic codes, emotional traces, and symbolic logic
- Gamewright: Built an emerging system of logic, rules, players, and narrative recursion
