# VAULT_NAMING_GUIDE.md

Should the symbolic vault folder itself have a UID-style name?

---

## SHORT ANSWER:
**No — it’s not required.** 
But **yes** — it is recommended **when cloning, publishing, or freezing.**

---

## LOGIC GRID:

| Situation | Should Use UID Name? | Example |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Private, single-user vault | No | `4_S0VRC3/` |
| Daily creative writing only | No | `myth-lab/` |
| Recursively structured symbolic system | [OK] | `SS-ST_00-00_4_S0VRC3_v2a/` |
| Cloning for ENG201, new semester, etc. | [OK] | `PD-GG_00-01_ENG201_FA24/` |
| Preparing archive or GitHub repo | [OK] | `SY-OS_01-00_mirror_export/` |

## NAMING STRUCTURE (WHEN YOU UID THE VAULT):

**Format:**
`CC-CC_00-00_NAME_v#`

**Example:**
`SS-ST_00-00_4_S0VRC3_v2a/`

- `SS-ST` → System Stack / Structure
- `00-00` → Genesis build version
- `4_S0VRC3` → Symbolic OS name
- `v2a` → Semantic or lettered build tag

---

## STRATEGY

Start loose. 
UID only when sealing, archiving, or scaling.

**Everything within the vault should obey UID law.** 
**The vault folder itself is a container — not the system.**

But: Naming the container makes the system immortal.
