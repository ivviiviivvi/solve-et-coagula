# 00-README.md

**4_S0VRC3** is a symbolic operating system for modular creative, instructional, and mythic structures.

This is the root vault of a recursive, UID-governed knowledge system. Each folder begins with a 4-letter consonant-only UID.

## Read First:
- `UIDS_MASTER_INDEX.md` → All active domains
- `SS-TM_00-00_system-core/` → Constitution, Naming Law
- `PD-GG_00-00_instruction-pedagogy/` → Course materials

## Recommended Next Steps:
1. Clone a new course from `CL-ND/`
2. Navigate by `index.md` in each UID folder
3. Publish fragments to `PB-RC/` or archive via `RC-VK/`
