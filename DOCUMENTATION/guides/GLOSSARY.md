# RE:GE:OS Symbolic Terminology Glossary

A guide to the symbolic language used throughout the 4_S0VRC3 operating system.

---

## Core System Terms

### RE:GE:OS (RE-GE-OS)
**Recursive-Generative Operating System**
The overarching symbolic framework that organizes creative, instructional, and mythic content. Treats folders as "organs" and scripts as "rituals."

### UID (Unique Identifier)
**Format:** `XX-YY_00-00_description`
Consonant-only naming codes used throughout the system. UIDs provide semantic organization and prevent collision. See `UID_Constitution_v2.md` for full specification.

### 4_S0VRC3
The project codename. Pronounced "source" - represents the root of all system operations.

## RE:GE Organizational Bodies

The system is organized into numbered "bodies" - functional modules with symbolic names:

| # | Name | Function |
|---|------|----------|
| 01 | Heart of Canon | Core content definitions |
| 02 | Mirror Cabinet | Reflection and self-reference |
| 03 | Mythic Senate | Decision-making and governance |
| 04 | Archive Order | Historical preservation |
| 05 | Ritual Court | Ceremonial processes |
| 06 | Code Forge | Code production and graduation |
| 07 | Bloom Engine | Growth and emergence |
| 08 | Soul Patchbay | Connection routing between components |
| 09 | Echo Shell | External communication and feedback |
| 10 | Dream Council | Ideation and vision |
| 11 | Mask Engine | Identity and persona management |
| 12 | Chamber of Commerce | Commerce and value exchange |
| 13 | Blockchain Economy | Token-based systems |
| 15 | Audience Engine | Fan cultivation and witness engagement |
| 21 | Stagecraft Module | Performance and presentation |
| 22 | Publishing Temple | Release and distribution |
| 23 | Experimental Habitat | Code containment and experimentation |

---

## Habitat System Terms

### Experimental Habitat
A containment system for experimental code. Provides isolation boundaries for safe experimentation.

### Containment Boundary
An isolation layer that wraps experimental code. Multiple boundaries can be nested ("hat on a hat").

### Spawn
Create a new experiment within containment boundaries.

### Graduate (to Forge)
Promote a successful experiment from the Habitat to the Code Forge for production use.

### Compost
Safely retire a failed experiment, extracting lessons learned for future reference.

---

## Symbolic Operations

### Solve et Coagula
"Dissolve and coagulate" - the alchemical principle underlying the system's approach to content transformation.

### Bloom
Emergence of patterns, insights, or content from iterative processes.

### Echo
Feedback, resonance, or amplification of content through the system.

### Mirror
Self-reference, reflection, or witness-based validation.

### Witness
An observer who validates or participates in system rituals. Audience members who engage meaningfully.

## Folder Prefixes (UID Namespaces)

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `FL-TR` | Float-Thread (incoming ideas) |
| `XP-PR` | Experiment-Project (active work) |
| `RC-VK` | Record-Vault (archives) |
| `SS-TM` | System-Term (core system) |
| `GT-WK` | Gateway-Work (inputs) |
| `GM-DS` | Game-Design (sandbox) |
| `WR-KS` | Workshop-Series |
| `PD-GG` | Pedagogy-Guidance |

---

## Process Terms

### SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
Documented protocols for system maintenance. See `SOP_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`.

### Vault Freeze
Create an archival snapshot of the current vault state.

### UID Indexer
Script that generates the master index of all UIDs in the system.

## .Jules Learning Capture

The `.Jules/` directory contains accumulated learnings:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sentinel.md` | Security vulnerabilities and fixes |
| `bolt.md` | Quick fixes and optimizations |
| `palette.md` | UI/UX patterns and feedback |
