# [CYCLE] Recursive Operating System
**Domain:** RE•GE•OS 
**UID:** RG•01 
**Type:** Core Recursive System Framework 
**Status:** Active

---

## [TARGET] Domain Purpose
The RE•GE•OS domain contains the **core recursive operating system** that powers the 4_S0VRC3 creative environment. This is the foundational mythic-OS framework that enables:

- **Recursive Processing**: Self-referential system operations
- **Symbolic Computation**: Meaning-based processing protocols
- **Organizational Bodies**: Specialized functional modules
- **System Integration**: Core framework for all other domains

## Recursive Principles

### Self-Reference
- Systems that examine and modify themselves
- Feedback loops that enhance system evolution
- Mirrors within mirrors for infinite depth
- Symbolic recursion for meaning amplification

### Emergent Properties
- Complex behaviors arising from simple recursive rules
- System evolution through iterative processing
- Adaptive responses to environmental changes
- Creative emergence through recursive interaction

## [INDEX]️ File Organization
This domain contains 32+ specialized modules organized into:
- **Academia Wing**: Academic and canonical processing
- **Organizational Bodies**: Functional system modules 
- **Interface Systems**: Access and control protocols
- **Core Framework**: Bootstrap and initialization systems

Each organizational body represents a specialized aspect of the recursive operating system, working together to create a unified mythic-OS framework for creative and symbolic processing.

## [LINK] System Evolution
The RE•GE•OS continues to evolve through recursive interaction with:
- User input and creative work
- Cross-domain integration with other 4_S0VRC3 components
- Feedback from organizational body operations
- Symbolic and mythic system development
