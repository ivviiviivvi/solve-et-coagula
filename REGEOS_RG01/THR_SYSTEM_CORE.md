# ::THR_SYSTEM_CORE::

### Purpose: Centralize, govern, and evolve RE:GE_OS + Obsidian Vault logic

---

## [OK] STATUS CHECKPOINT (as of May 4, 2025)

### [LINK] Reference Files Created:

- [FOLDER_CATALOG_FINAL.csv] — final system folder names, UID, and function
 
- [FINAL_FOLDER_COLLAPSE_SNAPSHOT.csv] — how all 35 legacy folders were sorted/condensed
 
- [NAME_STRUCTURE_OVERVIEW.md] — system naming rules, UID logic, legacy redirects
 
- [README_NOTES.zip] — Obsidian-ready readme files per canonical folder
 
- [THREAD_PROJECT_CROSSWALK_FINAL.csv] — full GPT thread mapping
 
- [FOLDER_COLLAPSE_PLANNER.csv] — editable planner to resolve remaining merges
 
- [SYSTEM_FOLDERS_DASHBOARD.md] — human-readable UID nav tree
 

---

## SYSTEM OBJECTIVES

1. Collapse and condense 35+ legacy folders into ~15 functional, symbolic organs
 
2. Assign each folder a `plain_text_name`, stylized `display_title`, and `UID`
 
3. Use YAML headers + Dataview to generate dashboards, maps, and filtered views
 
4. Generate per-thread digests and symbolic extractions
 
5. Build `SYST3M__M4P.md` — master vault tree of all logic, names, timelines, etc.

## [TOOLS]️ NEXT STEPS

### [REFRESH] Folder Merge Completion

- Review `FOLDER_COLLAPSE_PLANNER.csv`
 
- Manually finalize all 35 → 15 merges
 
- Update UIDs and symbolic trail
 

### [BOOK] Digest Pass (Thread Summaries)

- Generate one `.md` digest per GPT thread
 
- Populate `Linked Threads:` in each folder README
 
- Extract naming systems, open questions, symbols per thread
 

### [INDEX]️ System Manifest

- Build `SYST3M__M4P.md` with UID tree, folder purposes, naming logic
 
- Include legacy → new redirect map
 

### Audit + Crosscheck

- Confirm all Obsidian-imported folders reflect UID structure
 
- Ensure Hazel / Shortcuts logic reflects current map
 
- Update templates for Templater integration
