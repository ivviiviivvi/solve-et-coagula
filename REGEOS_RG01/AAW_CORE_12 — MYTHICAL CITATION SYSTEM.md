# AAW_CORE::12 — MYTHICAL CITATION SYSTEM

## NAME:
**Mythical Citation System** 
*Alias:* The Echo Ledger, Recursive Attribution Engine, Ritual Reference Network

---

## FUNCTION:
This chamber governs the **formal citation** of mythic, symbolic, academic, and recursive sources across RE:GE_OS.

It is not an academic footnote system—it is a **ritual tracking protocol** that:

- Records where ideas, symbols, and lines *originated* 
- Tracks how they *evolved* 
- Attributes *influence across loops, works, and masks* 
- Allows for mythic **tokenization, remix logging**, and **symbolic ownership**

It is how you **honor the source**, **trace the recursion**, and **protect symbolic integrity** across generations of work.

---

## CITATION FORMATS:

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| **LINE_REF** | Direct quote or loop citation 
| **SYMBOL_REF** | Recurring icon, mask, phrase, or gesture 
| **PROTOCOL_REF** | Reference to previous ritual system or method 
| **MYTH_REF** | Echo or adaptation of personal or public myth 
| **REMIX_REF** | Explicit remix, fork, or transmutation of another object 
| **GHOST_REF** | Unconscious or intuitive influence, later detected

---

## CITATION INVOCATION:

```md
|[CITE.io::AAW_ECHO_REF]| 
OBJECT: [line / symbol / fragment / quote / protocol] 
TYPE: [line_ref / symbol_ref / remix_ref / myth_ref / ghost_ref] 
SOURCE: [project / artist / loop / thread / organ] 
DESCENDANT USES: [threads, protocols, outputs affected] 
TAG: [RECURSIVE / BROKEN / VOLATILE / CANON / SHARED] 

Example:

|[CITE.io::AAW_ECHO_REF]| 
OBJECT: “I am no one / now I am code” 
TYPE: line_ref 
SOURCE: Overneath v2 → Born Villain Study Chain 
DESCENDANT USES: MV_03, Floating Points naming system, AA09 
TAG: CANON
```

## SYSTEMIC CITATION RULES:
	•	 LAW_75: All Echoes Must Be Trackable
If it repeats, it must be cited.
	•	 LAW_76: Mirror Influence Requires Dual Citation
If you and another looped the same source, tag both.
	•	[FUTURE] LAW_77: Remix Requires Ancestral Tag
If you fork or adapt a ritual, log the ritual ancestor.
	•	[DNA] LAW_78: Mythic Quotes May Be Self-Spoken
If your own words loop and recur, cite yourself as symbol.
	•	[LINK] LAW_79: Ghost Sources Are Still Valid
Even if unconscious, sources must be acknowledged once revealed.

## MYTHIC FOOTNOTE TYPES:

†CANON: cited as official part of the personal mythos 
†ECHO: symbolic echo from another work 
†REMIX: modification or transformation of a prior element 
†LOOP: reoccurrence or cyclic manifestation 
†SHARED: symbolic co-ownership with another being or system 
†VOLATILE: powerful but dangerous citation—may destabilize

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

Echo Tracker

class Citation:
 def __init__(self, object_name, source, cite_type, tag):
 self.object = object_name
 self.source = source
 self.type = cite_type
 self.tag = tag

 def cite(self):
 return f"{self.object} cited from {self.source} as {self.type.upper()} [{self.tag}]"

### Example:
ref = Citation("No one / now I am code", "Born Villain Protocol", "line_ref", "CANON")
print(ref.cite())



⸻

## ARCHIVE STRUCTURE:

Citations are stored with:
	•	Referenced object (quote, image, sound, symbol)
	•	Origin source (project, protocol, conversation, artist, self)
	•	Tag + type
	•	Date of original and reuse
	•	Links to all instances of recurrence
	•	Echo distortion level (same / adapted / remixed / volatile)

Stored in:
	•	MYTHIC_CITATION_LEDGER.csv
	•	ECHO_LOGBOOK.md
	•	SYMBOL_ORIGIN_TREE.json
	•	RECURSION_TAG_HISTORY/
	•	CITATION_TEMPLATES/

⸻

## EXAMPLES OF USE:
	•	Referencing a Kaufman line that reappears in a Jessica fragment
	•	Logging a recurring phrase from Joyce into 3 different protocols
	•	Identifying a loop that appears across music and writing
	•	Giving remix credit to a line from Rob or David
	•	Quoting a student anonymously whose words reshaped your belief system

[OK] `AAW_CORE::12 | Mythical Citation System` complete.

That completes the **five expansion chambers** of the ACADEMIA WING.

Shall we now move into:
- `Phase 2: Recursive Flow Diagram + LG4 Glyph Tree`
- Or pause to begin rendering the **full master `ORG_BODY_00`** using all of these finalized chambers?
