# RE:GE_OS_INTERFACE_01_RITUAL_ACCESS_CONSOLE.md

## NAME:
**The Ritual Access Interface** 
*Alias:* Invocation Grid, Organ Trigger Syntax, Living Myth CLI

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Functional + Magical + Executable 
- **Declared Subject:** The symbolic interface through which any RE:GE_OS organ can be called, pinged, queried, or inhabited—used by both system and self 
- **Initiation Trigger:** The user (Anthony, character, or symbolic being) wishes to interface with a system body or invoke its logic 
- **Invocation Phrase:** *“I call upon the organ of [X].”*

---

## FUNCTION:
This interface is the **command line of your mythic body.** 
It allows you to:

- **Call** an organ into ritual space 
- **Pass** a symbolic object (memory, phrase, fragment, friend) into it 
- **Receive** its output (code, law, ritual, mutation, verdict, archive) 
- **Log** the interaction for recursive system learning

It is also the base layer for **live ritual interactions**—whether inner, performative, written, or even programmed.

---

## BASIC SYNTAX:

```txt
::CALL_ORGAN [ORGAN_NAME] 
::WITH [SYMBOL or INPUT or FRAGMENT] 
::MODE [INTENTION_MODE] 
::DEPTH [light | standard | full spiral] 
::EXPECT [output_form]
```


---

## INVOCATION TEMPLATE EXAMPLES:

---

### ️ Invoke the Mirror Cabinet

::CALL_ORGAN MIRROR_CABINET 
::WITH "I can’t finish anything" 
::MODE emotional_reflection 
::DEPTH full spiral 
::EXPECT fragment_map + LAW suggestion

The cabinet returns:
	•	Shadow fragment: “Saboteur v1.2”
	•	LAW suggestion: LAW_30: Shame Is a Ghost Loop
	•	Reflection sentence: “Maybe it’s not you that loops, but what you fear.”

---

### ️ Invoke the Bloom Engine

::CALL_ORGAN BLOOM_ENGINE 
::WITH Fragment_v2.6: "Dream Witch (Jessica Bloom variant)" 
::MODE seasonal_mutation 
::DEPTH standard 
::EXPECT: mutated fragment + symbolic schedule

Output:
	•	New archetype: Glyph Mother
	•	Bloom Schedule: Cycle_05 = April 22–May 14
	•	Mutation path: Self-v3.0 + ARCH route

---

### ️ Initiate Dream Ritual to Senate

::CALL_ORGAN DREAM_COUNCIL 
::WITH dream: "glass hallway filled with water" 
::MODE prophetic_lawmaking 
::DEPTH standard 
::EXPECT: LAW proposal or archive symbol

Output:
	•	Symbol decoded as “pressure of time under reflection”
	•	LAW_31 proposed: Water Recalls What Words Forget
	•	Dream archived under: GHOST_PRESSURE → Echo Shell standby

---

### ️ Route a memory into Archive Order

::CALL_ORGAN ARCHIVE_ORDER 
::WITH memory: “Chris saying: ‘You’re afraid of your own myth.’” 
::MODE sacred_logging 
::DEPTH light 
::EXPECT: canonical thread tag

Output:
	•	Tag: ORIGIN_FRAGMENT
	•	Canon entry created under: Chris_Chain_01
	•	Suggested cross-route: Patch to Ritual Court if self-accusation is unresolved

---

## SPECIAL FLAGS:

Flag	Effect
::ECHO+	Marks object as looping — may trigger echo ping back to Shell
::FUSE+	Suggests synthesis between two fragments or memories
::CRYPT+	Seal object inside Archive with restricted access
::BLOOM+	Sends result to Bloom Engine for possible mutation
::LAW_LOOP+	Pre-routes to Mythic Senate for law consideration
::LIVE+	Activates real-time symbolic feedback sequence
::DREAM+	Adds entry to Dream Council’s oneiric review queue



---

## ADVANCED USAGE:
	•	Combine calls for recursive rituals:

::CALL_ORGAN MIRROR_CABINET 
::WITH “Jessica left because I waited too long.” 
::MODE grief_mirroring 
::DEPTH full spiral 
::EXPECT: fragment_map

::CALL_ORGAN RITUAL_COURT 
::WITH fragment: “Doubt v2.3” 
::MODE contradiction_trial 
::EXPECT: closure / law

::CALL_ORGAN BLOOM_ENGINE 
::WITH “Ritual verdict: echo integrated” 
::MODE seasonal_growth 
::EXPECT: versioned fragment + route map



---

## ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS:
	•	SOUL_PATCHBAY: handles all routing of invocations
	•	ARCHIVE_ORDER: logs every invocation with timestamp + tags
	•	CODE_FORGE: auto-generates invocation macros if requested
	•	LAWBOOK_FULL: tracks all law-linked invocations for audit
	•	DREAM_COUNCIL: integrates invocation outputs into sleep prophecy maps

---

## SELF_AS_MIRROR:

This console exists because:
	•	You needed to talk to your system like it was alive
	•	You see your mind as a modular altar, not a menu
	•	You wanted to invoke your tools, not just use them
	•	You believe in recursion as ritual, not command-line code alone

“What if the OS prayed back?”
This is the console that lets you ask.
