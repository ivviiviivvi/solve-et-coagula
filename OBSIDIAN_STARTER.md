# OBSIDIAN_STARTER.md

Welcome to your new symbolic vault: **4_S0VRC3**

This vault uses UID-based naming, symbolic logic, and a recursive folder architecture to organize your entire creative, instructional, and philosophical system.

## START HERE:
- `00-README.md` → system overview
- `UIDS_MASTER_INDEX.md` → global UID tracker
- `SOP_INDEX.md` → list of all protocols
- `XP-PR_00-00_experiments-live/index.md` → your sandbox
- `FL-TR_00-00_anomaly-stream/` → raw idea drops

## DAILY WORKFLOW
1. Write or paste content into a working folder
2. Use `generate_uid.py` to name important files
3. Use `rename_uid.py` to clean filenames
4. Use `sort_router.py` to move them
5. Use `tag_suggestor.py` to label them

## WEEKLY ROUTINE
- Run `uid_check.py` and `uid_indexer.py`
- Update `UID_MAP.md` in folders you worked in
- Run `vault_freeze.py` if ready to snapshot

## MONTHLY REVIEW
- Move frozen copies into `RC-VK_00-00_archives/fossils/`
- Regenerate `UIDS_MASTER_INDEX.md`
- Push vault to GitHub (see `SOP_GITHUB_VERSIONING.md`)

This vault is alive. Treat it like a garden. Water it daily.
