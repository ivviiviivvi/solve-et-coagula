# SOP_SYMBOLIC_NAMING.md

How to name folders and files in the 4_S0VRC3 system.

## UID Format:
`CC-CC_00-00_label`

- First block = 2 consonants from first word
- Second block = 2 consonants from second word
- `00-00` = versioning or order markers

## Rules:
- No vowels or Y in UID
- Use index.md and UID_MAP.md for navigation
- Use markdown file names with hyphens, not spaces

Every name carries function and symbolic meaning.
