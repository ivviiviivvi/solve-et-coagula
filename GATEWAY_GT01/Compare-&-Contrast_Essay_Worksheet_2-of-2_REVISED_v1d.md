*Turning Your Observations into a Comparative Essay* {#PLM-014-intro}

This worksheet will guide you through writing a full compare-and-contrast essay using your notes from the triadic analysis of *Ponyo* (Miyazaki, 2008) and *The Little Mermaid* (Disney, 1989).

You are expected to:
- Analyze similarities and differences between the films
- Reflect on your personal or cultural response
- Construct a clear, focused thesis
- Support your argument with evidence from the texts

Complete each section as you work through the essay writing process. Each section is scaffolded with prompts and space to brainstorm, outline, and begin full paragraphs.

---

# `PLM-014A` – `PLM-014A` – ️ Step 1: Your Working Thesis {#PLM-014A}

A strong compare-and-contrast thesis:
- Names both subjects (the two films)
- Highlights one core meaningful similarity or difference
- Connects to a bigger idea or cultural/thematic concern

### [?] What theme are you focusing on?
Choose one or circle yours:
- Transformation
- Love & Relationship
- Gender or Agency
- Nature or Environment
- Cultural Values or Morality
- Other: ____________________________

---

### [SEARCH] What is one key insight you’ve found through comparison?

Write in this format:

**Although both [Film A] and [Film B] ___________, they differ in how they ___________, revealing that ___________.**

Example: 
Although both *Ponyo* and *The Little Mermaid* explore transformation as a path to love, they differ in how they portray the cost of that transformation—one as ecological disruption and the other as personal sacrifice—revealing how culture shapes our understanding of what love demands.

Now try your own below:

**Thesis Sentence Draft:** 
__________________________________________________________________________ 
__________________________________________________________________________ 
__________________________________________________________________________

Check your draft: 
- [OK] Are both films named?
- [OK] Is a key similarity or difference clear?
- [OK] Does it express a deeper insight or value?

---

### `PLM-014A2` – Alternate Thesis Frame {#PLM-014A2}

Write your thesis using this alternate frame if your ideas emphasize contrast more strongly:

**While both [Film A] and [Film B] __________, only one __________, showing that __________.**

---

# `PLM-014B` – `PLM-014B` – [COMPASS] Step 2: Drafting Your Introduction {#PLM-014B}

Your introduction sets the stage for your argument. It should:

1. **Hook the reader** – Start with a compelling idea, image, or question
2. **Introduce the two texts** – Give basic context: title, director, country, year
3. **Preview the theme** – Let the reader know the topic or guiding lens
4. **End with your thesis** – (from Step 1) This is your anchor

---

## HOOK

A good hook connects the films to something larger: 
- A myth, question, trend, or value 
- Something philosophical or visual 

Examples:
- “What do we give up when we choose love?” 
- “In mythology, transformation is rarely free. In animation, it’s beautiful.” 
- “Stories about mermaids aren’t really about water—they’re about becoming someone else.”

Now try your own:

**Hook Idea:** 
__________________________________________________________________________ 
__________________________________________________________________________ 

---

## INTRODUCE THE TEXTS

Answer the following and use in full sentences later:

- What country or culture is each film from? 
 *Ponyo*: ________________________ 
 *The Little Mermaid*: ________________________

- When were they released? 
 *Ponyo*: __________ 
 *The Little Mermaid*: __________

- What genre or type of story are they? 
 (e.g., myth adaptation, fantasy, children’s film, coming-of-age) 
 ______________________________________________________________________

Now write 1–2 sentences that introduce the films clearly: 
__________________________________________________________________________ 
__________________________________________________________________________

# `PLM-014D` – `PLM-014D` – [SEED] Step 4: Reflecting on Your Cultural Lens {#PLM-014D}
