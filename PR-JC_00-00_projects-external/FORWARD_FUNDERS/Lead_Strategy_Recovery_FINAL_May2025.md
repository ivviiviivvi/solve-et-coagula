# Lead Strategy Recovery Plan – May 2025

## 1. Quick Context
We paused Facebook ads too frequently, which prevented Meta from completing its learning phase.  
Performance dropped due to lack of optimization and rising cost-per-lead.  
Current budget is $25/week, which is too low to allow meaningful learning or lead generation.

---

## 2. Current Facebook Status
- Facebook ad is drafted and pending approval.  
- At $25/week (~$3.50/day), we expect only 1–2 leads/week.  
- Meta requires ~50 leads/week to stabilize and exit the learning phase.  
- **Action:** Pause Facebook campaigns for now. Do not delete past ad sets; they may be reused later for lookalike targeting.

## 3. Google Search Campaign – MCA_Search_Intent_01
**Objective:** Drive low-volume, high-intent leads efficiently.

- **Daily Budget:** $8/day (run in 4-day bursts)  
- **Geography:** Only fundable states  
- **Ad Groups:** 'Business Loans Now', 'Same-Day Funding', 'MCA Fast'  
- **Keywords (Exact + Phrase):**  
  `[business loan fast]` `[merchant cash advance today]` `[get working capital now]`  
- **Negative Keywords:** free, grant, startup, sba, bad credit, no collateral  
- **Landing Option:** Google Form or Typeform with Name, Phone, Monthly Revenue  
- **Conversion Tracking:** Track Form Submit as a Lead + enable Call Extensions

## 4. Budget Requirements & Learning Math
Meta requires ~50 conversion events per week to exit learning.  
If each lead costs $10–20, you'd need $500–1,000/week.

**Budget Estimations:**  
- $10/lead → $500/week  
- $15/lead → $750/week  
- $20/lead → $1,000/week  

**Rule of Thumb:** Weekly Budget = Cost Per Lead × 50  
Each +$5 in CPL adds $250 in required weekly spend.  
Google Search has lighter learning requirements, ideal for lower budgets.

## 5. Action Guidelines – Do & Don’t

**DO:**  
- Launch Google Search in $32 burst tests  
- Respond to leads within 5 minutes  
- Track every call in a shared sheet or basic CRM (e.g. HubSpot Free)  

**DON’T:**  
- Waste $3/day on Meta campaigns that won’t optimize  
- Send cold traffic to an untrustworthy or slow site  
- Re-enable FB ads until $100–150 test spend is available
